This is the first react web app for blog based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

To simulate the backend service, [Json Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) is used.
To start the json server by following command, and it will run on port 5000:
### `npm run jsonserver`

In project, `url.js` defines the request url for backend service(RESTful) and `request.js` wraps the fetch api for `get`, `post` and `put`.

1. React Router for frontend routing
2. faker and lodash for backend data fake
